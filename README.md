# Titanic Survival Prediction Model #
## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Titanic survival prediction model. The model predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle or loaded using the Seaborn library in Python. The dataset consists of information about passengers, including their demographics and survival status.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.



Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git


Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

## Dependencies

Python 

Google colab

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Titanic survival.
